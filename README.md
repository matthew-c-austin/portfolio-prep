Preparation for Personal Portfolio Site

## Tell me about yourself

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

1. A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

    Web Developer

2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

    Born Again Full Stack Developer | Reformed Aerospace Engineer

3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

    I am a structural analysis engineer turned software developer. I have proven expertise in leading technical teams in the development of complex, safety critical systems in the aerospace industry, where requirements are vast and varied and immutable; where documentation is king and attention to detail is paramount. I’ve always been drawn to the innovative culture of tech, In tech, constant adaption and learning is not only encouraged but required for success, something that I feel is very much missing in my current work. This career switch has reignited my passion for learning, and I feel an almost gnawing hunger to grow my skills and establish myself as a high performer in a brand-new setting. I’m hoping to leverage that drive, along with the skills I’ve developed as an aerospace engineer, into a dynamic and exciting career in tech!

4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

    I love how dynamic the tech industry is. There's always something new to learn, something new to create.

## Gather your assets

A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

1. A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
